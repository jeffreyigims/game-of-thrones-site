        <h2>Jon Snow</h2>
        <p>
          Jon Snow, born Aegon Targaryen, is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar
          Targaryen, the late Prince of Dragonstone. From infancy, Jon is
          presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother,
          and raised alongside his lawful children at Winterfell, the seat of
          House Stark. However, his true parentage is kept secret from everyone,
          including Jon himself, in order to protect him from those that sought
          the complete annihilation of House Targaryen after Robert's Rebellion
          and to maintain order in the realm.
        </p>

        <h2>Daenerys Targaryen</h2>
        <p>
          Queen Daenerys I Targaryen, also known as Daenerys Stormborn, and
          colloquially known as Dany, was the younger sister of Rhaegar
          Targaryen and Viserys Targaryen and only daughter of King Aerys II
          Targaryen and Queen Rhaella Targaryen, who were both ousted from the
          Iron Throne during Robert's Rebellion. She also served a brief tenure
          as the de facto Queen of the Andals and the First Men and the
          twenty-first ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, after claiming the throne
          from her predecessor Cersei I Lannister, who was killed in the Battle
          of King's Landing. However, she was never formally crowned, nor did
          she sit upon the Iron Throne.
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Arya Stark</h2>
        <p>
          Arya then plays a significant role in the Great War, effectively
          ending the conflict through her killing of the Night King during the
          Battle of Winterfell. Afterwards, Arya rides south with Sandor Clegane
          to kill Cersei Lannister, not intent on returning to Winterfell. She
          arrives at King's Landing as it is being destroyed by Daenerys
          Targaryen. Sandor convinces Arya to abandon her quest for vengeance
          and Arya tries to help the smallfolk survive the destruction of King's
          Landing, though she fails. Weeks later, following Daenerys's
          assassination to stop her further destruction, Arya is part of the
          great council that decides the future of Westeros, during which Arya's
          younger brother Bran is chosen as king.
        </p>

        <h2>Tyrion Lannister</h2>
        <p>
          Lord Tyrion Lannister is the youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister
          and younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. A dwarf, he uses
          his wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice he faces. He is the
          current Lord of Casterly Rock and Hand of the King to Brandon Stark.
